## Common Issues and Solutions

   * Bug: Elements with a fixed height or width may cause overflow issues, especially when the content inside them dynamically changes or when viewed on devices with different screen sizes. This can result in content being cut off or overlapping with other elements.

   * Solution: To resolve this issue, you can use CSS properties such as overflow: auto or overflow: hidden to control how content overflows within the element. Alternatively, consider using CSS techniques like flexbox or grid layout to create more flexible and responsive designs that can adapt to varying content sizes and screen resolutions.
